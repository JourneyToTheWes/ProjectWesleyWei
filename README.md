# ProjectWesleyWei

## Overview
This website is dedicated to channel my inner web development creativity and from what I learned from Info 343 (client side web development). Here you can browse through my resume, videos, and projects that I worked on over the years. This project will keep on undergoing changes as I continue to gain more knowledge whether it be from class or personal curiosity.
