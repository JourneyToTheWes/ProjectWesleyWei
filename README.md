## Overview
This website is dedicated to channeling my inner web development creativity. WestWay focuses on what I am learning in Full-stack Development and pushes those skills onto a website that showcases myself, resume, videos, and my personal projects that I have worked on in the past.

## Getting Started

### Work Locally
After cloning the repository, we can execute the following steps to start working locally.

> Prereqs: Get setup with MongoDB Atlas first. Once their is a collection setup with all of the proper DB schemas, we need to copy the MongoDB URI connection string and paste that into the `project-wesley-wei\config\default.json` config file.

1. Change directory into `project-wesley-wei-server`
    1. Run `npm install`
    2. Run `npm run dev`
2. Change directory into `project-wesley-wei-client`
    1. Run `npm install`
    2. Run `npm run start`

Congratulations! We should now have a running WestWay application locally.

### Deployment
Follow [Deployment Guide](DeploymentGuide.md)

> `Model Four React` branch/version of this application is being deployed on `Fly.io`. Note: hosting service may be subject to change in the future depending on development needs/requirements as need be.
